# FiddleOS

An experiment. I would say unlikely to be completed but this is a topic so interesting that I'd never forgive myself if I didn't complete it.

### Prerequisites (for compilation)

Cargo deps:
- `cargo-xbuild` for cross-compilation
- `bootimage` to create a bootable image

Other deps:
- `qemu` for virtualization. Not strictly necessary, but very convenient.
- GNU Make; not strictly necessary, but used for convenience.
